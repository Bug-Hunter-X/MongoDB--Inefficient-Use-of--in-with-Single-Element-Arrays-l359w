# MongoDB $in Operator Inefficiency

This example demonstrates an uncommon MongoDB error involving the `$in` operator when used with a single-element array.  While functionally correct in some cases, it's considered less efficient than a simple equality comparison.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect usage of `$in`:

```javascript
// Incorrect use of $in operator with a single element array
db.collection.find({field: {$in: [value]}});
```

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides the improved approach:

```javascript
// More efficient direct comparison
db.collection.find({field: value});
```

Using direct comparison (`field: value`) is generally preferred for better performance and readability when dealing with a single value.
